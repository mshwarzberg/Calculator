Dealing with parentheses:

userInp = 36+(3×(2.1÷6÷(32+3)+6)÷7)+9+(3-3)

Find the first '('

leftParenth = 0
rightParenth = 0

loop through userInp starting at the index of the first '('

as long as leftParenth does not equal rightParenth and leftParenth does not equal zero...

loop one: (at index 13 leftParenth finally equals 3)
loop two: (at index 2 leftParenth finally equals 2)
loop three: (at index 6 leftParenth finally equals 2)
if the character in the string equals '(' add 1 to leftParenth.

loop one: (at index 24 rightParenth finally equals 3 and the loop breaks)
loop two: (at index 18 rightParenth finally equals 2 and the loop breaks)
loop three: (at index 11 rightParenth finally equals 1 and the loop breaks)
if the character in the string equals ')' add 1 to rightParenth.


3×(2.1÷6÷(32+3)+6)÷7
2.1÷6÷(32+3)+6
32+3
once rightParenth equals leftParenth return the new string without the outermost parentheses

calculate the arithmetic set

find the parentheses and the arithmetic set in the original string

remove the parentheses and the arithmetic operation 

loop through the new string again
